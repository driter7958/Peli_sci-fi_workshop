This workshop is designed to be a space where ideas come to life, and every project, no matter how big or small, gets the attention it deserves. Together, we can build something great.

## Inspired by Peli Motto: Resourceful, Gritty, and Ready to Build

At the heart of our workshop is a spirit inspired by *The Mandalorian’s* Peli Motto – a character who embodies resourcefulness, grit, and a deep love for building and fixing things. [Wookieepedia](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Peli_Motto) Like Peli, we believe in:

- **Rolling Up Our Sleeves**: This is a hands-on community where everyone is encouraged to get involved, problem-solve, and make things work, no matter the challenges.  
- **Embracing Imperfection**: Things don’t always go smoothly, and that’s okay. Like Peli, we know that the best creations often come from trial, error, and a bit of improvisation.  
- **Supporting Each Other**: Just as Peli always has the back of her crew, this community is about helping each other out – offering advice, feedback, and a hand when needed.
